## Building the application
 There are three periods during our project with many steps:
 1. Django system
   1.1 Find the OCR library
   1.2 Use tesseract for transcribing (But not accurate)
   1.3 Build Django work
   1.4 Use Transkribus instead
   1.5 Build many functions basing on Django (Creating, catagorying, searching, editing, deleting)
 2. Jkan system
   2.1 Build open data system basing on Jkan
   2.2 Immigrate data gradually
   2.3 Adjust the layout/categories/organization and many other configs
   2.4 Add more functions according to requirements of customer
 3. Automatic Jkan system
   3.1 Use github actions
   3.2 Write a python script to achieve all things automatically

## Testing the build
How do I test the code to ensure the build is correct?
  
## Running the application
